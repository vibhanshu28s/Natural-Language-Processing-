       "He had come to the surface facing down the stream; in a moment the\n",
       "visible world seemed to wheel slowly round, himself the pivotal point,\n",
       "and he saw the bridge, the fort, the soldiers upon the bridge, the\n",
       "captain, the sergeant, the two privates, his executioners.  They were\n",
       "in silhouette against the blue sky.  They shouted and gesticulated,\n",
       "pointing at him.  The captain had drawn his pistol, but did not fire;\n",

       "their forms gigantic.\n",

       "Suddenly he heard a sharp report and something struck the water\n",

       "\n",
       "A counter-swirl had caught Farquhar and turned him half round; he was\n",
       "again looking at the forest on the bank opposite the fort.  The sound\n",
       "of a clear, high voice in a monotonous singsong now rang out behind\n",
       "him and came across the water with a distinctness that pierced and\n",
       "subdued all other sounds, even the beating of the ripples in his ears.\n",
       "Although no soldier, he had frequented camps enough to know the dread\n",
       "significance of that deliberate, drawling, aspirated chant; the\n",

       "metal, singularly flattened, oscillating slowly downward.  Some of\n",
       "them touched him on the face and hands, then fell away, continuing\n",

       "\n",

       "to safety.  The soldiers had almost finished reloading; the metal\n",
       "ramrods flashed all at once in the sunshine as they were drawn from\n",
